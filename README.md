## Overview

This project aims to provide recommendations to the XYZ, we aim to advise them - based on the readily available data, on their decisions to be able to grow the company with XYZ. Contained in this repository you will find an iPython Notebook, graphs, and analysis of the data that was provided to us by our Flatiron teachers (**Nick McCarty** and **Virgina Tech**) regarding the Video Game industry, as well as resulting video game enthusiasts and businesses we have obtained from working with said information and arrived to as a conclusion of us tinkering with the data.

The iPython Notebook that we've been working on as a team, as well as the presentation and this README file are all related to our insights for the VideogameTweets project. They are all based on the data obtained from the websites: XYZ.


## Business Understanding

Our key business variable for this study is *profit*; we want to help XYZ in making the correct decision when looking to make improvements and higher quality business decisions. 
The main questions we will be answering will be:

EXAMPLE:
- **Does a big budget influence revenue?** 
  - This is to know the funds they should allocate to the project
